                <h2>A Clinician's Guide to Healthy Eating for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention</h2>
            
                <p>The recently released 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease has given clinicians a comprehensive, evidence-based resource to inform management of patients at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition to guidance on risk stratification and medication prescribing, the Prevention Guideline stresses the importance of lifestyle intervention through diet and exercise. However, dietary counseling remains difficult for many clinicians as it seems the landscape is continually shifting.</p>
                <p>Popular culture espouses a wide variety of dietary myths and trends, so-called "fad" diets. However, nutrition science has consistently demonstrated that a healthy diet is comprised of high quantities of non-starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes plus moderate consumption of nuts, seafood, lean meats, low-fat dairy and vegetable oil. Calorie restriction and portion control must exist in every diet to maintain a healthy weight. However, many physicians and patients need greater specificity regarding food choices.</p>
                <p>To provide clinicians with an evidence-based approach to dietary counseling, Pallazola et al. reviewed the available evidence.1 This review focuses on the basic tenets of a healthy diet, evidence-based dietary patterns, risk factor specific nutritional interventions and integrates tips for dietary counseling of patients.</p>

                <p><b>Carbohydrates</b></p>
                <p>Carbohydrates exist on a spectrum from simple to complex, which differ in how quickly they are digested and absorbed. Complex carbohydrates (legumes, whole grains) should be substituted for simple carbohydrates (white flour/rice, table sugar) given their association with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, cancer risk and all-cause mortality.</p>
                <p>A major source of simple carbohydrates in many diets remains sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and the authors identify one simple intervention that all patients can make regardless of socioeconomic status (SES): eliminate SSBs in their diet in favor of water (plain, carbonated, unsweetened or flavored). Reminding patients that fruit juices, smoothies, and sweet teas are a similar source of refined sugar in addition to concentrated calories is also important. In addition, physicians should be reminded that these beverages have not demonstrated improved health when compared to whole fruit.</p>
                <img src="Carbs_1.jpg" alt="Heart Disease Survivor" class="image">

                <p><b>Fruits and Vegetables</b></p>
                <p>Whole fruit and vegetables remain staples in a healthy diet and are widely-recommended. Simply consuming a higher proportion of fruits and vegetables is a great place to start with most patients, but if refinement is needed, leafy green vegetables and berry consumption (3 servings per week) have been shown to have health benefits as well. Starchy vegetables (white potatoes, corn, green peas) are rich in complex carbohydrates but calorically dense and should be consumed in moderation. Whole fruit is preferable to dried fruit because whole fruit is both more filling, has a lower sugar content, and is less calorically dense.</p>

                <p><b>Fats</b></p>
                <p>Dietary fats exist on a spectrum of chemical composition that includes trans-, saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fat. Trans-fats are strongly associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and should be minimized. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has taken steps to decrease the amount of trans-fat in food but they still exist in many processed and snack foods (frozen pizza, fast food, crackers, cookies, cakes, frozen pies, etc.).</p>
                <p>Saturated fats are similarly found in a variety of processed foods, red meat, cheese, whole milk, and butter and should also be limited in a healthy diet. Reduction has been associated with lower LDL-C levels. Mono- and polyunsaturated fats should be consumed in moderation and can be found in non-tropical vegetable fats and other fats that are liquid at room temperature.</p>
                <p>Dairy products are a source of fats but current data suggest either neutral or protective associations with cardiovascular health; skim or 1% milk is still recommended over whole milk. Cooking oils contain varying amounts of unsaturated, saturated and trans fats, with extra virgin olive oil and canola oil generally recommended over butter, margarine, and coconut oil.</p>

                <p><b>Meats</b></p>
                <p>Guidelines continue to recommend moderate consumption of lean poultry, seafood and nuts while limiting red meat. Processed meats such as deli/cold cuts, sausage, and bacon have the greatest association with adverse health outcomes and should be minimized. Fish may be especially important because of higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids which are recommended to replace saturated fats; salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good options.</p>
                <img src="Meats_1.jpg" alt="Heart Disease Survivor" class="image">

                <p><b>Diet Patterns</b></p>
                <p>These basic principles are incorporated into the dietary patterns with the highest level of evidence to support them: Mediterranean, DASH and the Healthy Vegetarian diets. The first two have been linked to lower risk for mortality from coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease and all causes.</p>
                <p>The Mediterranean diet focuses on 1) high leafy green vegetable intake, fruits, whole grains, nuts, legumes and extra virgin olive oil; 2) moderate intake of fish, lean meats, low fat dairy, poultry; 3) low intake of red meats and sweets; 4) wine in moderation.</p>
                <p>The DASH diet is similar but has greater allowance for dairy, a sodium intake limit and less emphasis on seafood. The Healthy Vegetarian diet maintains the same principles but substitutes soy products, legumes, nuts and whole grains for meat, seafood and poultry. A vegan diet eliminates all animal-derived products, which has also demonstrated improved health outcomes, but with an increased risk of deficiencies in certain vitamins.</p>
                <p>Low-carbohydrate high protein/fat (LCHF) diets have gained in popularity recently and have been associated with weight loss and increased insulin sensitivity but also increased LDL-C levels. They also may be associated with increased all-cause mortality when used for extended periods. The authors of the review feel there is insufficient evidence for clinicians to recommend LCHF for cardiovascular health.</p>
                <p>Calorie restriction and carbohydrate reduction, especially in patients with diabetes, remain mainstays of therapy. Patients also need to choose foods with a low glycemic index. The quality as opposed to quantity of fat intake is also important in the development of type 2 diabetes.</p>
                <p>Lipid control is strongly tied to the selection of fats and simple substitutions in some cases can make a large difference. The authors say this could be particularly important in ethnic/native diets where these substitutions can greatly reduce their health risks while maintaining the culture of the food. The authors also acknowledge the importance of reduced sodium intake (<2 grams) in patients with high blood pressure.</p>

                <h2>Optimum nutritional strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention and rehabilitation (BACPR)</h2>
                
                <p><b>Macronutrients</b></p>
                <p><b>Protein</b></p>
                <p>There is a long-standing argument that high protein intakes lead to renal failure with a recent observational study suggesting that increased protein intake post-myocardial infarction (MI) was associated with a greater decline in renal function and increased risk of mortality. Of interest, dairy or plant protein sources showed a much weaker association when compared with animal protein, and the relationship between protein and outcome variables was stronger in those with predisposing disease, for example, diabetes. This indicates that the source of dietary protein may be important to consider. Indeed, randomised controlled trials show that the quality of meat (in addition to the whole diet) is likely to be an important factor to consider in explaining this relationship, with evidence suggesting that the addition of lean red meat to an already low saturated fat cardioprotective diet does not impact negatively on blood lipids. The saturated fat content of the comparison diet may be an additional piece of the puzzle in explaining the impact dietary protein (and its source) has on cardiovascular health.</p>
                <p>Protein provides the main components for muscle synthesis and consensus opinion suggests that protein intakes should be higher in the elderly with intakes up to 1.5 g/kg/d being shown to improve body composition in an elderly, frail population. Collectively, these studies highlight an important role for protein in cardiovascular health, especially when considering (a) source (animal vs plant); (b) quality and (c) overall diet quality.</p>

                <p><b>Carbohydrates</b></p>
                <p>The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study raised carbohydrates to the forefront of cardiovascular health with headline data showing higher carbohydrate intake was associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. However, recent meta-analyses examining the association between carbohydrate intake and cardiovascular health have suggested a U-shaped relationship between carbohydrate and all-cause mortality, specifically in those consuming a low-carbohydrate diet higher in animal protein and fat.</p>
                <p>Prospective cohort studies have shown fibre intake to be inversely associated with reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality post-MI. In this study, only cereal fibre was significantly associated with a reduction in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in both men and women. One of the most prominent sources of cereal fibre is whole grain, and whole grain is frequently cited as being beneficial for health; however, there is disparity between meta-analyses of cohort studies and results from randomised controlled trials. Such discrepancy between this and prospective studies likely highlights the importance of adequately defining whole grain, and taking a whole diet approach when considering cardioprotective foods.</p>
                
                <p><b>Fats</b></p>
                <p>The correct balance of dietary fats is a key to cardiovascular health; however, as with carbohydrates and protein types, sources and amounts have made determining effects difficult. Saturated fat has long been suggested to be harmful for cardiovascular health; however, a recent meta-analysis suggested that reducing saturated fat did not seem to affect total mortality or CVD mortality. However, a reduction in combined cardiovascular events of 17% was shown with a reduction in saturated fat. Greater decreases in events were seen for studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats when compared with monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate, or protein. Thus, it would appear reducing saturated fat and replacement with unsaturated fat conveys the greatest cardiovascular benefit, not necessarily reducing saturated fat and replacing with refined carbohydrate, and some of this effect may be modified by where the saturated fat is found—that is, dairy versus processed baked goods.</p>
                <p>Increased trans fat intake is positively associated with total mortality, along with animal monounsaturated fats, alpha linolenic acid and arachidonic acid. In this same study, marine n3 polyunsaturated fat and replacement of saturated fat with plant monounsaturated fat were associated with lower total and CVD mortality. This latter study acknowledges the subtypes of fat such as n3 (alpha linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) and n6 fatty acids (linoleic acid and gamma-linoleic acid). Indeed, n6 fatty acids have been shown to reduce risk of MI, as well as reducing total cholesterol (TC), with these findings possibly relating to both baseline n6 intake and dose of n6 provided. This latter point is similar to observations made in the most recent analysis of fish oil supplements and cardiovascular health. This analysis indicated no benefit from supplementation on reducing fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or any CVD in people with or at high risk of CVD, primarily due to the low dose of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid used in the included studies (226 to 1800 mg/day and 0 to 1700 mg/day, respectively). These null results contrast substantially with the positive effects seen with the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial utilising a highly purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid (4 g/day). Further research into specific fat replacements for saturated fat is warranted and it is unclear whether there is additional benefit to maintaining a lower saturated fat diet while on lipid-lowering treatment. As with protein and carbohydrate, the source of the nutrient (ie, food) matters.</p>

                <p><b>Fruits and vegetables</b></p>
                <p>The grouping of fruits together with vegetables is inaccurate, similarly to the grouping of red and processed meat. This ignores distinct differences between fruits and vegetables in terms of their nutrient profile, and hence their association with disease. Fruits and vegetables high in nutrients are hypothesised to be cardioprotective and have consistently been associated with reduced CVD. Hence, fruits and vegetables are cornerstones of cardioprotective dietary patterns (eg, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean) and dietary guidelines ubiquitously recommend them.</p>

                <p><b>Eggs</b></p>
                <p>Eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol, typically containing 150–230 mg/egg. With the exception of eggs, prawns and liver, most foods rich in cholesterol are also high in saturated fat and it is well established that dietary saturated fat influences levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) to a much greater extent than dietary cholesterol in foods. However, the association of egg consumption (and dietary cholesterol) with CVD remains controversial and confusing for patients, particularly those with existing heart disease. The lack of good quality evidence to support the restriction of eggs has resulted in recent changes to guidelines with many removing any reference to limiting egg and cholesterol intake, although this is still highlighted in the most recent American guidelines from primary prevention of CVD.</p>
                <img src="Eggs_2.jpg" alt="Heart Disease Survivor" class="image">

                <p><b>Dairy</b></p>
                <p>Dairy products have received a great deal of attention in terms of their effect on CVD risk primarily due to their saturated fat content of butter, whole milk and yoghurt, and most cheeses. However, there is increasing evidence that suggests dairy products may actually have a neutral or even a beneficial impact on CVD risk, and that some of the uncertainty in evidence may be related to the different types of dairy. This has been shown by Patterson et al who also highlighted the importance of considering the calcium content of the food. In their analysis, the inverse association between total dairy intake and risk of MI was attenuated by adjustment for calcium with similar observations for cheese and MI risk.</p>
