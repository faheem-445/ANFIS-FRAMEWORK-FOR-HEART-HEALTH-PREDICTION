        <h2>Transforming Heart Health with AI-Powered Predictions</h2>
        <p>Heart disease and heart attacks continue to be the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early detection and risk assessment essential for prevention. To tackle this growing health concern, we have developed an advanced dual-stage Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) framework, leveraging machine learning and fuzzy logic to provide accurate, data-driven predictions. Our system is built using the Cleveland Clinic dataset, a highly trusted source of cardiovascular health data, ensuring that our predictions are rooted in scientific evidence and medical research. </p>
        <p>The integration of AI-driven decision-making allows for a more precise evaluation of risk factors, enabling individuals to take control of their heart health with confidence. By combining computational intelligence and predictive modeling, we bridge the gap between complex medical data and accessible health insights, empowering users with reliable assessments tailored to their unique health profiles.</p>

        <h2>Dual-Stage ANFIS: A Two-Step Risk Evaluation Process</h2>
        <p>Our dual-stage ANFIS framework is designed to analyze heart health in two phases, offering a structured and detailed risk assessment. In the first stage, the system predicts heart disease by applying Gaussian membership functions, which allow for smooth and accurate classification based on key health indicators like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age. This method ensures that subtle variations in cardiovascular risk factors are captured effectively, minimizing false positives and negatives.</p>
        <p>If a user is identified as being at risk in this phase, they are further analyzed in the second stage, where the system predicts heart attack probability using Generalized Bell membership functions. This function enhances adaptability, allowing for a more refined and flexible risk assessment by dynamically adjusting to individual health patterns and risk levels. Together, these two models offer a comprehensive, multi-layered evaluation of cardiovascular risk, ensuring users receive personalized and accurate health insights.</p>

        <h2>AI-Powered Chatbot for Instant Heart Health Guidance</h2>
        <p>We have integrated two advanced LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models with the Dash framework to make heart health insights more accessible and interactive, creating an AI-driven chatbot that provides real-time, personalized responses to user queries. This chatbot serves as a virtual heart health assistant, designed to answer questions related to heart disease, heart attack risks, symptoms, lifestyle changes, and prevention strategies.</p>
        <p>The first LSTM model is specialized in heart disease-related queries, while the second model is tailored to heart attack risk assessment, ensuring that users receive the most relevant and precise responses based on their concerns. By leveraging deep learning and natural language processing (NLP), our chatbot can understand user intent, analyze complex queries, and deliver accurate, evidence-based health recommendations in a conversational manner.</p>

        <h2>Seamless User Experience with Dash-Based Interaction</h2>
        <p>Our Dash-powered chatbot interface is designed to be user-friendly and highly interactive, ensuring that individuals can easily engage with the system for heart health insights. Unlike static health information sources, our chatbot adapts to user inputs, providing personalized suggestions and guidance tailored to their specific health conditions.</p>
        <p>The combination of LSTM deep learning models, NLP capabilities, and an interactive Dash framework enables our chatbot to function as an intelligent health companion, guiding users through their heart health journey with scientifically backed recommendations and proactive insights. This integration of AI and healthcare ensures that individuals receive real-time support while making informed health decisions.</p>
